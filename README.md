# PM2.5_Prediction

This project is about PM2.5 prediction using machine learning and environmental science. A comparative analysis of various models will be conducted to determine
which one yields the highest predictive power in identifying the factors that affect air quality in Pretoria, South Africa. The selected model will take into account multiple variants of air pollutants,
including Black Carbon (BC), UV-PM, Pb. Additionally, NO2, SO2 and CO levels will help investigate which features highly affect the prediction of the particle matter. Furthermore, the relationship between these pollutants and weather attributes
obtained is be studied. It also aims to investigate the relationship between different air pollutants and how season affects air quality in Pretoria, South Africa.

The performance of these models could be evaluated with statistical measures such as: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Coefficient of Determination (R2)
